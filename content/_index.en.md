# Containers Aerial Framework Workshop with Sionna for Telco Research and Simulation

This workshop teaches you how to build reproducible telecommunications simulation research environments using Docker containers and Git version management with NVIDIA Sionna and Aerial Framework.

## Workshop Overview

### Target Audience
This workshop is designed for **telecommunications researchers**. It is particularly suitable for:
- Wireless communication system researchers
- 5G/6G communication technology developers
- Communication signal processing and AI/ML researchers
- Research teams requiring telecommunications simulation environment setup

### Background
Modern telecommunications system research requires complex AI/ML workloads and large-scale simulations. This workshop provides hands-on learning to build reproducible and collaborative research environments based on Docker container technology and Git version management using NVIDIA Sionna and Aerial Framework.

## Learning Objectives
