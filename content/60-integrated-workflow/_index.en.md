# Integrated Workflow Practice

**Reproducible Research Environment Using Docker + Git + ECR**

Having learned Docker containers, Git version control, and ECR image sharing in previous modules, now it's time to integrate all these components into a complete workflow used in actual research environments. Experience the entire process from experiment change tracking to team collaboration through Sionna PHY Abstraction experiments.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Upon completing this module, you will be able to:

- Build reproducible experiment environments integrating Docker + Git + ECR
- Systematically track and manage experiment parameter changes with Git
- Implement team collaboration workflows through ECR experiment environment sharing
- Verify experiment result reproducibility and perform version-based comparative analysis

## 📚 Module Structure

This integrated workflow module is organized as follows:

### [1. Experiment Environment Integration](experiment-integration/)
- Setting up Sionna PHY Abstraction experiment environment
- Creating Docker + Git integrated project structure
- Configuring experiment parameter files and scripts
- Running basic experiments and verifying results

### [2. Collaboration Workflow Implementation](collaboration-workflow/)
- Tracking experiment changes and commit strategies with Git
- Sharing experiment environment images through ECR
- Reproducing experiments and verifying results among team members
- Comparing and analyzing experiment results by version

## 🚀 Getting Started

Experience the complete workflow used in actual research environments. Practice the entire process of isolating environments with Docker, tracking changes with Git, and sharing with teams through ECR using Sionna experiments. Start with the first section: [Experiment Environment Integration](experiment-integration/).
